# Lernfeld09 Network Management Tool

Welcome to the Lernfeld09 Network Management Tool! This project is developed within the scope of **Rahmen der lernfeld09** and offers a versatile solution to manage and retrieve information about your networks.

## Features:

- **Credential Management**: Easily add your credentials (username, password, and network controller token) in the `credentials.json` file. This provides a seamless experience in accessing and managing your networks.
- **Server Initialization**: Kickstart your server either by:
  - Running the command: `python run app.py`
  - Or, by directly launching the GUI, which in turn starts the server automatically for you.
- **Direct Server Requests**: In scenarios where the GUI isn't running, you can directly send HTTP requests to the server to fetch details about the respective networks.

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Add your credentials in the `credentials.json` file.
3. Start the server or the GUI as per your convenience.
4. Send requests or use the GUI to manage and view network details.
